# Contributing to Books2Rec

We are eternally grateful to you for wanting to contribute to this project. In order to make sure everything goes smootly, make sure you follow the below guidelines.

These guidelines were inspired by [Ruby on Rails guidelines](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### I found a bug in your code

First, ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dorukkilitcioglu/book-recommender-system/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### I wrote a patch that fixes a bug

First, Make sure that you follow the general coding conventions of the project. Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### I want to do a major refactor

That's great, but unless the refactor is very important and it is immensely useful, we cannot accept it. It simply takes too much time to ensure everything is working as intended.

### I want to add a new feature

Open up a new [issue](https://github.com/dorukkilitcioglu/book-recommender-system/issues) with your proposed feature. If it is too out-of-scope for this project, chances are we don't have the time or motivation to add it. But never hesitate to speak your mind!

### Anything else?

If your contribution does not fit into these guidelines, don't hesitate to contact us.
