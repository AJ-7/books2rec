# Books2Rec: Machine Learning meets Reading

<img src="data/images/books2rec.png" alt="Books2Rec Screenshot" width="80%">
Books2Rec is a book recommender system built for the Big Data Science class at NYU. Using your [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) profile, Books2Rec uses Machine Learning methods to provide you with highly personalized book recommendations. Don't have a Goodreads profile? We've got you covered - just search for your favorite book.

## Introduction
Recommender systems is at the forefront of the ways in which content-serving websites like Facebook, Amazon, Spotify, etc. interact with its users. It is said that 35% of Amazon.comâ€™s revenue is generated by its recommendation engine<sup>[1]</sup>. Given this climate, it is paramount that websites aim to serve the best personalized content possible.

As a trio of book lovers, we looked at Goodreads, the world's largest site for readers and book recommendations. It is owned by Amazon, which itself has a stellar recommendation engine. However, we found that their recommendations leave a lot to be desired.

We are using a hybrid recommender system in order to provide recommendations for Goodreads users.

## Project Structure
As heavily encouraged by our advisor, Dr. Anasse Bari, we have tried a lot of different technologies in our quest to make a book recommender system. As such, we have multiple different mini-projects in this repo. These are mostly contained into individual folders.

### Data Sources
#### Goodbooks 10k
Download the Goodreads data from [goodbooks-10k repository](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k), extract it, and place it under the `data` folder (so that the `ratings.csv` file would be at `data/goodbooks-10k/ratings.csv`). You might also want to extract the `books_xml.zip` to see and use the full xml documents.

#### Amazon Ratings
The Amazon ratings were kindly provided by [Jure Leskovec](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html) and [Julian McAuley](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/). We used the subset of the book ratings that matched the Goodbooks 10k dataset.

#### Data Preprocessing

### <a name="rapidminer"></a><img src="data/images/rapidminer-logo.png" alt="RapidMiner Logo" width="30%">
[RapidMiner](https://rapidminer.com/) is a Data Science platform that allows for rapid prototyping of Machine Learning algorithms. We used RapidMiner to get a 'feel' for our data. It was great for quickly applying models and seeing their results, but it proved inflexible, and it could not handle more than 12000 users until there was a memory error or an array overflow. The RapidMiner `rmp` files that were used to generate the recommendations can be found in the [RapidMiner](RapidMiner/) folder. They were able to achieve a RMSE of 0.864 and a MAE of 0.685.

### <a name="mahout"></a><img src="data/images/mahout-logo.svg" alt="Mahout Logo" width="30%">
[Apache Mahout](https://mahout.apache.org/) is a distributed linear algebra framework that has a lot of built-in Machine Learning algorithms. Crucially for us, it implements a lot of the most common algorithms for recommender systems out of the box. We used Mahout's `ItemBasedRecommender` in order to generate item recommendations. The Eclipse project that was used to generate recommendations can be found in the [Mahout/RecommenderSystem](Mahout/RecommenderSystem) folder.

### Surprise
[Surprise](http://surpriselib.com/) is a Python library designed to generate recommendations and evaluate recommenders. It provides a nice API and a nice pipeline for recommender systems, but we found that it was not as malleable as we wanted it to be. It proved to be quite difficult getting different sorts of recommenders to work nicely with it's pipeline, but standard algorithms like SVD was a breeze.

We used the Surprise library in order to do matrix factorization on the user-item matrix. The SVD algorithm of Surprise uses Gradient Descent to optimize the RMSE, which is one of our end goals. This differs from the regular SVD, where the regular one tries to minimize the matrix reconstruction error. The crucial difference is that **Surprise does not assume that unrated items are rated as 0.**

There are multiple hyperparameters one can use for training the SVD model. We used Grid Search on the hyperparameter space in order to find the best hyperparameters, with the help of [NYU High Performance Computing](https://wikis.nyu.edu/display/NYUHPC/High+Performance+Computing+at+NYU). The code for that can be found in the [HPC](HPC/) folder.
