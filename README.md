A book recommender system built for the Big Data Science class at NYU

## Data Sources
Download the data from [goodbooks-10k repository](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k), extract it, and place it under the `data` folder (so that the `ratings.csv` file would be at `data/goodbooks-10k/ratings.csv`). You might also want to extract the `books_xml.zip` to see and use the full xml documents.
